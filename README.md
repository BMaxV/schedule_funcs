# schedule_funcs

Module to do calculations around tasks, on a weekly base for now.

Goals are to add functionality around feedback / reporting, functions to serialize and deserialize.

Later as a separate object, maybe desktop notifications or something.

There is a rendering function over here https://github.com/BMaxV/schedule_render but that won't work because what I'm doing it with is code I will keep private.

Here are pictures of output:
